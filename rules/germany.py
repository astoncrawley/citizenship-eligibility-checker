    Implements German nationality law (simplified but realistic logic):
    Key principles:
    1. **By descent (jus sanguinis)**: A child automatically becomes a German citizen if at least one parent
    was a German citizen at the time of birth. Before 1975, only the father could transmit citizenship if
    parents were married; since 1975, either parent can.
    2. **By birth in Germany (jus soli, since 2000)**: If a child is born in Germany after 1 Jan 2000 and at least
    one parent has been legally resident for 8+ years *and* holds permanent residency, the child gains citizenship.
    3. **By naturalization**: Not modeled here, but we acknowledge it could be added later.
